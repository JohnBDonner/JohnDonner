<p>I am an optimistic developer, designer and entrepreneur. Creating products that combine aesthetics and function, where engineering meets design, is a passion of mine. I tend to have incredibly high standards for the work that I do; I try to set the bar just under impossible.</p>
<p>I love larger-than-life things, including but not limited to: epic sounding chordal progressions, success stories and projects that leave a positive impact on the masses. If you would like me to be a part of your world-shattering idea, drop me a line at one of the social links above.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, I'm reading, brainstorming, producing music, djing or socializing.</p>
